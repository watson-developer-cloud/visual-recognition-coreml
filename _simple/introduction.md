Watson on the IBM Cloud allows you to integrate a powerful AI into your applications and store, train, and manage your data in the most secure cloud. With Watson Visual Recognition, you can quickly and accurately tag, classify, and train visual content using machine learning.

This code pattern is a workshop to introduce you to the Watson Visual Recognition capabilities for Core ML right from iPhone and iPad.

You will learn how to integrate Watson services in your iOS application and how to leverage Core ML APIs to enable artificial intelligence features directly on device.
